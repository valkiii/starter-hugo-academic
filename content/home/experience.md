        Responsibilities:
        
        * Developed the framework to define and analyse customer journeys based on click event data. Built a probabilistic model on top of it to estimate customers' conversion date and propensity to churn. Proposed an innovative network based model to define mesoscopic states (aggregation of click events) to build a Markov Chain model.
        * Supervising a number of junior and medior data scientists in their development of churn models, propensity to buy models, and recommendation systems.
        * Developed ML solutions to define the drivers to understand the NPS bank's performance and provided actionable insights to the stakeholders. 
        * Supervised a number of NPL projects that involves classification of small datasets of short sentences. Solved the problem b proposing a combination of local models to deal with the high complexity of the problem.
        * Involved in orchestrating the basis of the NBA framework aimed to automatise, improve, and personalise the bank's actions towards our customers - ongoing project.

        * The LondHeNet project aims to define performance indicators for the Helium hotspots already active in London, and to implement ML approaches to predicting network performance and rewards on new hotspots deployed in the city.
        
        Responsabilities:
        
        * Planning and running the data science approach to the problem, producing pipeline of ML approaches and providing simulations to evaluate the performance of the hotspots geographical disposition.
        * The final output of the project is an android mobile application designed to enable the Helium community to explore the landscape of performance of the London Helium Network in terms of signal transmission, activity, and rewards based on the disposition in the city of new hotspots. 
        * Dealing with our app developer to provide optimal solutions to scale real time results to be served in the app.
