        Project description: 
        
        * The LondHeNet project aims to define performance indicators for the Helium hotspots already active in London, and to implement ML approaches to predicting network performance and rewards on new hotspots deployed in the city.
        
                
        Responsabilities:
        
        * In charge of planning and running the data science approach to the problem, producing a pipeline of different ML approaches and providing simulations to solve the hotspots geographical optimization problem.
        * The final output of the project is the prototype of an android mobile application designed to enable the Helium community to explore the landscape of performance of the London Helium Network in terms of signal transmission, activity, and rewards based on the disposition in the city of new hotspots. To do so, I interfaced with the app developer to provide optimal solutions to scale real time results to be served in the app.
