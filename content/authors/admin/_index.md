I currently work as a data scientist at [ABN Amro](https://www.abnamro.nl/nl/prive/index.html) were by applying data science to a multitude of use cases (churning problems, propensity to buy, reccomender systems) I help creating the bank of tomorrow. 

Previously, I worked at [Barclays](https://www.barclays.co.uk), but the nostalgia for continental Europe stroke strong again and I decided to move to Amsterdam, just to keep my lifestyle "international". 

I received my PhD from the [School of Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/), where I worked within the Complex Systems and Networks Research Group under the supervision of [Vito Latora](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=jXTPa_AAAAAJ&hl=en).
